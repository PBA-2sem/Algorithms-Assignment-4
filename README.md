# Algorithms - Assignment # 4

## Technologies

- Java

## Description

We have made a deterministic state machine that matches inputs towards JSON syntax.

- example of JSON syntax: "{\"key\":\"value\"}"
- In the code the quotation marks **"** are escaped.

Try to change the **json** variable in **Program.java** and see if you can find limitations to our finite state machine. 

We have also made a more simple deterministic state machine that checks if input matches the string "Yolo".

## How to run

- Run the file **Program.java** in the aiport package
